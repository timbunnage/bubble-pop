    - When I was 5, I planted this garden with my father

    - I don't remember much, but I do remember the smell of the dirt
    - I remember the effort, the hours, and the sweating
  - paragraphList:
    - Most of all, I remember his patience and focus
    - Despite the heat, he exuded a quiet comfort

    - I couldn't understand the woman on the TV, so my father sat me down
    - He said, 'some things are going to change'
    - '''I have to be going to work more often now.'''
    - '''But more will change for your friends, and for most people'''
    - '''We''re lucky.'''
    - '''Lend them a hand when you can.'''
    - He seemed sombre

    - When I was 13, I became popular at school
  - paragraphList:
    - My father was in the headlines for his botany work at The Corporation
  - paragraphList:
    - Of course, he'd told me all about it before the media broke the news
    - He'd created a new plant
    - Something that grew quick, that didn't need much tending to
  - paragraphList:
    - Something made of metal
  - paragraphList:
    - I wanted to learn everything about it
    - I started borrowing botany textbooks from his study

    - The Corporation was in the news again"
    - Another scientific breakthrough
  - paragraphList:
    - They'd cross pollinated real flowers with the metal ones
    - Creating new metal flower variants
    - Roses became brass, and violets became stainless steel
  - paragraphList:
    - They played a video of a 'metal petal' farm during a bloom
    - The scraping of all the petals opening sounded like...
    - ... Like a screeching chorus of dying cats

    - Later that year was the big one
    - With genetic modifications, the flowers could grow objects in the buds
    - and when they bloomed they could be picked straight out of the ovary
  - paragraphList:
    - Electrical wires made of copper
    - Lightbulb filaments made of tungsten
    - Bullet cores made of steel

    - At 17, I was ear against the door of my father's study
    - He had said some important people would be here
  - paragraphList:
    - They wanted to overclock the metal petals in order to win the war
    - It had been a stalemate for too long
    - There was shouting... he was shouting...
    - ... Then, murmuring
  - paragraphList:
    - The important people left, and I peeked inside
    - He was staring out the window, at the garden

    - The war officially ended a couple months after that
    - Apparently, we'd overpowered them easily
    - It was the day after my 18th birthday, and everyone was celebrating
    - My father didn't join in though
    - He had sectioned off a portion of the garden under a tent
    - He was spending all his time in there, working on something
    - I wasn't allowed in
    - I think some important people came that day too
  - paragraphList:
    - That evening, after everyone went home...
    - he told me something
  - paragraphList:
    - He said we needed to start preparing
    - Something big was coming
    - and he was working to try and stop it
    - Something that would affect everyone
  - paragraphList:
    - He told me that the war only went the way it did because of his metal flower
    - I remember thinking that was a good thing
  - paragraphList:
    - The following weeks, he was the most tense I'd ever seen him
    - Rushing in and out of his garden tent from morning to evening...
    - ... then working late into the night, often till sunrise
    - He was barely getting any sleep, and I wasn't seeing him much

    - It was one of those evenings he was out in the garden tent...
    - ...when the news broke publicly
  - paragraphList:
    - Someone had leaked information
    - The metal petals had been growing unconstrained beyond their farms
    - and they were spreading rapidly
    - Just requiring dirt, they could grow anywhere and everywhere
    - Eating up natural resources in the environment
    - The Corporation stayed silent about the news
  - paragraphList:
    - My father was on a short phone call with someone, then hung up
    - He invited me into the tent for the first time

  - paragraphList:
    - He told me that the metal petals...
    - ... they were spreading much faster than the news was saying
    - He had been experimenting on the flowers in our garden
    - Trying to create a natural weapon to fight back against the spread
    - But the best he'd been able to do so far was just delay the inevitable
    - There wasn't going to be enough time find a real solution
    - The metal petals had already started ravaging the ecosystem
    - In turn causing mass famines
  - paragraphList:
    - We stocked up on the chemicals we needed and all the food we could
    - He was exhausted
  - paragraphList:
    - As the metal petals spread across the country...
    - ... I became his lab assistant, struggling to try new methods...
    - ... new experiments...
    - ... doing what I could with what little I knew from him and his books
  - paragraphList:
    - My father became hyper focused
    - I would wake up in the middle of the night and he'd still be out in the tent
    - Pushing himself to the brink of extreme fatigue
    - Day and night... over and over...
    - ... and over...
    - ... and over...
  - paragraphList:
    - Until...
